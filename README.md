👋 Hi, I’m @Maminiainerick. I'm a Junior Fullstack Developer.

👀 I’m especially interested in Frontend technologies, as I am really passionate about graphic art and what can contribute to the beauty of the Web.

👨‍🎓 Recently graduated in Computer Science at Université de Grenoble Alpes, I'm currently operational on several front-end technologies, such as **React.JS**, **Remix.run**, **Angular**, **Vue.JS** and **Quasar**

🌱 I’m looking to collaborate on meaningful projects, that reaches lots of people and makes sense for people everyday lives.

📫 For more information, don't hesitate to send me an email on maminiainerick.dev@outlook.fr
